Address 0x7ffd4bf3a3e5 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 37 in frame
    #0 0x4011d4 in main /home/xry111/lecture/debug/code/scanf_bound.cc:5

  This frame has 1 object(s):
    [32, 37) 'buf' (line 6) <== Memory access at offset 37 overflows this variable
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
